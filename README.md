Citi Bike is New York City's bike sharing system. It was launched in 2013 and is known to be an effiecient way of transportation in NY. Citi bike was also created in effort to reduce emmissions and have hopes of improving health.Using data collected from the Citi Bike program, I was able to create visualtions and produce an analysis of the 2018 citi bike data.
